Before ordering anything, keep in mind that the materials below has alternatives. However, I recommend you to use the op-amps that
are listed below. Resistor and capacitor values may vary depending on the cut-off frequencies.

BILL of MATERIALS:
1- AD-620 (Main component)
2- 10uF x 2
3- 1uF x 2
4- 158.4 kohm (add the necessary values in series & parallel to get this resistance)
5- 8040 ohm x 2
6- LF411 x 2
7- 33kohm x 2
8- 15kohm
9- 100nF x 2
10- 220 nF x 2 
11- Stripboard
12- Male headers x 6 (for inputs and outputs)
13- 3 Lead electrode cable
14- ECG Electrode
