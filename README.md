# ECG-Signal-Acquisition
In this project, an elctrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) device is undertaken using AD620. 
The design includes high &amp; low-pass filters, amplification, offset addition, analog to digital converter and a notch filter. 
The processed data is sent to MATLAB using Arduino and further processed in it. Finally, beat-per-minute rate is calculated in MATLAB.


Before doing anything, have a look at the design guide because all the information you need is mentioned there. 
The project consists of two parts. 
1- Hardware
2- Software (Arduino- Matlab)

All the specifications and details for both hardware and software are given in the design guide.
After setting the hardware, you can start to proceed in software by sending the datas to Arduino using Analog inputs. 
Then send the data to MATLAB. In this way, you can work on the real time ECG signal in MATLAB, apply filters, 
and use BPM calculation algorithms.

To open MATLAB app, open fsroot and drag app3 to your MATLAB interface. you will see all the codes and the user friendly GUI.
